    <h1>Learn HTML and CSS - For Beginners</h1>
    <h2>
      Greetings, and welcome to this comprehensive 
      HTML and CSS guide. My goal is to teach you 
      everything you need to know about building 
      fast and beautiful websites.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I'm assuming you have no knowledge of HTML 
      or CSS and want to learn everything from 
      scratch. So this guide is beginner-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this tutorial is to teach 
      the fundamentals of HTML and CSS that 
      you'll use in web development.
    <h3>
      Now, let's jump in and get started!
    </h3>
    <P>
      I don't have table of contents but this is
      what you will need to follow along.
    </P>
    <p>
      For a start, you will need a code editor. 
      There are so many code editors out there, 
      like Visual Studio Code(VS Code), 
      Sublime Text, Atom and so on. 
      <p>
        In this tutorial, I am going to use VS 
        Code, along with a few extensions for 
        starting a web server and formatting 
        our code and you will need a browser.
        I will use Chrome.
    </p>

    <P>
      Now, here inside VS Code, we are going to install a couple of extensions.

    <p>
      So, let's open the extensions panel, and search for Prettier.

      Here is the extension we are going to 
      install &#8209 the Prettier Code Formatter.

    <p>
      Next, we are going to install another 
      extension called Live Server. With this, 
      we can launch our website inside a 
      Development Web Server.
    </p>

  Now, let me give you a simple roadmap to know
   where you are and where you should go next.
</p>
<img src="images/vsc.gif" alt="Computer man"
<p>
  Websites have two parts: a frontend and a backend.
</p>
<p>
  The frontend is the part you see in your browser 
  and interract with. All the visual aspects.
</p>
<p>
  So, web development jobs fall into three main categories:
  <ol>
    <li>Front-End Development</li>
    <li>Back-End Development</li>
    <li>Full-Stack Development (which involves both Front-End Development and Back-End Development)</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  In this guide, we will deal with 
  Front-End Developers which uses HTML, CSS, a
  nd JavaScript to build front-ends.
</p>
<p>So, now let's talk about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
  <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
  <p>
    HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language. 
    I know it is a mouthful but basically, 
    we use HTML to define the structure or 
    building blocks of our web pages.
  </p>
  <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
  <p>
    CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. 
    We use it for styling web pages, and making 
    them beautiful.
  </p>
  <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript is used to add functionality 
    to web pages. Let me give you an analogy.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, as you move from one project to another, 
    you may want to learn about the other tools
